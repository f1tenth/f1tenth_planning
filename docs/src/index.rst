F1TENTH Autonomous Racing Software Stack
====================================================

Overview
----------
This is the documentation for F1TENTH's Autonomous Racing Software Stack. The stack will be split into three main topics: Perception, Planning, and Control.
We'll try to include all software algorithms we've encountered, tested, and used in our research in Autonomous Racing. This repo is constantly being updated. If you have algorithms that you've used in your Autonomous Racing applications and wish to make it open source, please consider :ref:`contribute <doc_contribution_guide>` to this repo.

---------
If you use any open source implementations mentioned in this repo NOT authored by us, please cite the original authors and give proper credits. All original author information will be included in the documentation if not authored by us.
